        <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious treat that you can enjoy during a birthday or whenever you want to satisfy your sweet tooth!</p>
        <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>2 cups plain / all purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups caster / superfine sugar</li>
            <li>115g / 1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>3 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>3 tsp vegetable or canola oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan) for 20 minutes before starting the batter </li>
            <li>Grease 2 x 20cm / 8” cake pans with butter, then line with parchment / baking paper.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs for 30 seconds on speed 6 of a Stand Mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, or hand beater.</li>
            <li>With the beater still going, pour the sugar in over 45 seconds.</li>
            <li>Then beat for 7 minutes on speed 8, or until tripled in volume and white.</li>
            <li> While egg is beating, place butter and milk in a heatproof jug and microwave 2 minutes on high to melt butter (or use stove). Do not let milk bubble and boil (foam ok). Don’t do this ahead and let the milk cool </li>
            <li>When the egg is whipped, scatter 1/3 flour across surface, then beat on Speed 1 for 5 seconds. Add half remaining flour, then mix on Speed 1 for 5 sec. Add remaining flour, then mix on Speed 1 for 5 – 10 sec until the flour is just mixed in. Once you can’t see flour, stop straight away.</li>
            <li>Pour hot milk, vanilla and oil into the now empty flour bowl. Add about 1 1/2 cups (2 ladles or so) of the Egg Batter into the Milk-Butter (don't need to be 100% accurate with amount). Use a whisk to mix until smooth – you can be vigorous here. Will look foamy.</li>
            <li>Turn beater back on Speed 1 then pour the Milk mixture into the Egg Batter over 15 seconds, then turn beater off.</li>
            <li>Scrape down sides and base of bowl. Beat on Speed 1 for 10 seconds – batter should now be smooth and pourable.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into pans.</li>
            <li>Bang each cake pan on the counter 3 times to knock out big bubbles</li>
            <li>Bake 30 minutes or until golden and toothpick inserted into centre comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven. Cool in cake pans for 15 minutes, then gently turn out onto cooling racks. If using as layer cakes, cool upside down – slight dome will flatten perfectly. Level cake = neat layers</li>
            <li>Frost with frosting of choice, or cream and fresh berries or jam.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
