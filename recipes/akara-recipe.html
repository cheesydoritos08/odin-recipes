        <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
        <p>A dish native to Nigeria that uses beans and vegetables to create this round treat that can be enjoyed with custard or eaten alone as a quick snack!</p>
        <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>2 cups black-eyed peas dry</li>
            <li>1 Small habanero</li>
            <li>3 ounces red bell pepper approximately half of one red bell pepper</li>
            <li>1 small onion finely chopped</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons crayfish (unblended) If you have it in the ground form you need 2 tablespoons</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 chicken bouillon cube</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water for blending, a little extra might be required</li>
            <li>vegetable oil enough for deep frying</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Soak the beans in room temperature water for about 15 to 20 minutes until the skin is swollen.</li>
            <li>Drain the water and place the beans in the food processor. Pulse the food processor a few times to remove the skin from the beans.</li>
            <li>Pour the beans into a large bowl, add enough water, and gently swirl the beans around so the skin can float. Discard the skin into a colander. Repeat this process until the beans are clean.</li>
            <li>Pour the clean beans into a blender, add the water, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, salt, bouillon powder, and crayfish, and blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into a large bowl and whisk it until it’s light and fluffy – hand whisk for about 3 to 4 minutes, or use an electric hand mixer for about a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Add the finely diced onion and gently fold with a wooden spoon or spatula in one direction.</li>
            <li>Heat some oil (enough to fry the Akara) in a pan on medium to high heat. Drop heaping tablespoons of batter into the hot oil, frying in batches to prevent overcrowding. Flip once or twice to ensure even browning—fry the Akara for about five to six minutes, or until golden brown on all sides.</li>
            <li>Before removing any Akara from the oil, gently press them down to remove any excess oil.</li>
            <li>Remove the Akara from the pan and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Serve with bread, pap, oatmeal, yogurt, or other desired side.</li>
