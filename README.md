# odin-recipes

- This current project is about creating a recipe book that contains the recipes for several different types of food
- When this project is over I will be able to:
    - Create and format text on a webpage
    - Link words and images to other pages on my website
    - Learn the proper usage of different text tags such as <\h1> and <\p>
